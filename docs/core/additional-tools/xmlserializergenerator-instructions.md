# Using Microsoft XML Serializer Generator on .NET Core

This tutorial teaches you how to use the Microsoft XML Serializer Generator in a C# .NET Core application. During the course of this tutorial, you learn:

> * How to create a .NET Core app.
> * How to add a reference to the Microsoft.XmlSerializer.Generator package
> * How to edit your MyApp.csproj to add dependencies.
> * How to add a class and an XmlSerializer
> * How to build and run the application 

Like the [Xml Serializer Generator (sgen.exe)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/xml-serializer-generator-tool-sgen-exe) for .NET Framework, <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> NuGet package is the equivalent for .NET Core and .NET Standard projects. It creates an XML serialization assembly for types contained in an assembly to improve the startup performance of XML serialization when serializing or de-serializing objects of those types using XmlSerializer.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial:

* [.NET Core SDK 2.1.3 or later](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
* Install your favorite code editor, if you haven't already.

> [!TIP]
> Need to install a code editor? Try [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com/downloads)!
  
## Use Microsoft XML Serializer Generator in a .NET Core console application 

The following instructions show you how to use XML Serializer Generator in a .NET Core console application.

### Create a .NET Core console application

Open a command prompt and create a folder named *MyApp*. Navigate to the folder you created and type the following commands:

```console
dotnet new console
```

### Add a reference to the Microsoft.XmlSerializer.Generator package in the MyApp project.

 Type:
 
 ```console
 dotnet add package Microsoft.XmlSerializer.Generator -v 1.0.0
 ```
 
### Verify changes to MyApp.csproj after adding the package

Open your text editor and let's get started! We're still working from the *MyApp* directory we built the app in.

After running the command, the following lines are added to your *MyApp.csproj* project file:

 ```xml
 <ItemGroup>
    <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.XmlSerializer.Generator" Version="1.0.0" />
 </ItemGroup>
 ```
 
### Add a class in the application. 

Open *Program.cs* in your text editor. Add the class named *MyClass* in *Program.cs*.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public int Value;
}
```    

### Create an `XmlSerializer` for MyClass.  

Add the following line inside *Main* to create an `XmlSerializer` for MyClass:

```csharp
var serializer = new System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer(typeof(MyClass));
```    

### Build and run the application

Still within the *MyApp* folder, run the application via [`dotnet run`](../tools/dotnet-run.md)  and it will automatically load and use the pre-generated serializers at runtime.

Type the following in your console window:

 ```console
 $ dotnet run
 ```
> [!NOTE]
> [`dotnet run`](../tools/dotnet-run.md) calls [`dotnet build`](../tools/dotnet-build.md) to ensure that the build targets have been built, and then calls `dotnet <assembly.dll>` to run the target application.

If everything succeeds, an assembly named *MyApp.XmlSerializers.dll* is generated in the output folder. 

Congratulations! you have just:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a .NET Core app.
> * Added a reference to the Microsoft.XmlSerializer.Generator package
> * Edited your MyApp.csproj to add dependencies.
> * Added a class and an XmlSerializer
> * Built and ran the application
